Manager Manuel Pellegrini says Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is the best striker in the Premier League.

Aguero, 27, scored a hat-trick against Chelsea on Saturday to move to 21 league goals this season, one behind leading scorer Harry Kane of Tottenham.

The Argentine has scored 99 Premier League goals in five seasons at City.

"Sergio makes the difference when he's playing every game, every week. I am sure he is the best striker in this league," said Pellegrini.

This is the second consecutive season in which Aguero has struck more than 20 goals, having managed 26 last term.

But despite another prolific season, Aguero has not been included on the shortlist for the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year.

"It is very strange that Sergio has played so many years here and has never been the best player in the Premier League," added the Chilean.
