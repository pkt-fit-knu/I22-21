Gareth Bale reached 16 goals for the first time in a La Liga season as Real Madrid thrashed Getafe 5-1 to move one point behind leaders Barcelona.

Real's seventh successive league win kept alive their hopes of a first title since 2012 and sent neighbours Getafe to the bottom of the table.

Karim Benzema put Real ahead and after Isco made it 2-0 at half-time, Bale raced clear to add the third.

Getafe replied before James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo added late goals.

Barca, who have taken just one point from the last possible nine, play at home to Valencia on Sunday (19:30 BST).

Real kept the pressure on the defending champions, while Juan Esnaider made a losing start as Getafe's new coach. His side have now lost 11 of their past 13 games.
